# Updraft smart contracts
Updraft is a decentralized crowdfunding protocol for "Ideas" and "Solutions" to those ideas.

## Protocol features

* Time-based rewards: Contributors earn increasing shares over time through cycle-based accrual
* Dual-layer funding: Ideas get initial funding, then Solutions can be proposed and funded separately
* Community incentives: Contributor fees are distributed proportionally to long-term supporters
* Cross-chain compatibility: Solutions can reference Ideas from other chains
* Anti-spam mechanisms: Minimal fees prevent spam while keeping participation accessible
* Funders can identify and support dependencies to create visible dependency chains.
* Updraft creates a sustainable ecosystem where good ideas get funded, solutions get developed, and long-term community members are rewarded for their continued support.
